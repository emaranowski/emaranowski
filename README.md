**Hi, I'm Erica**. I love clean code that works seamlessly for those who use it. I thrive on perfectionism, solving puzzles, and the satisfaction of building elegant systems. I'm experienced on the backend in Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, JavaScript, Express, and Sequelize, as well as on the frontend in JavaScript, React, Redux, and HTML/CSS. I expanded to web development after 3.5 years of SPSS for data evaluation and engineering.

My past work includes data evaluation of funding at over 50 economic opportunity nonprofits in Oregon; managing statewide survey programs; developing databases; B2B and B2C research; and research on funding and social networks in public and private education.

I grew up below the poverty line and have traveled to a dozen countries (mainly Germany, Taiwan, and the Netherlands). I'm compelled by ambitious people and organizations fostering growth in society. Outside of work, you can catch me reading sci-fi, exercising, and cooking nutritious food. &nbsp; ðŸŒ±
