**Hi, I'm Erica**. I love building elegant software that works seamlessly for those who use it. I'm experienced on the backend in Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, JavaScript, Express, and Sequelize, and on the frontend in JavaScript, React, Redux, and HTML/CSS. I grew into web development after 3.5 years of SPSS for data evaluation and engineering.

I thrive on perfectionism, solving puzzles, and the satisfaction of designing cohesive and performant infrastructure. My background in data informs my focus on organized code, detail, excellent documentation, and technical communication.

My past work includes data evaluation of funding at over 50 economic opportunity nonprofits in Oregon; managing statewide survey programs; developing databases; B2B and B2C research; and research on funding and social networks in education.

I grew up below the poverty line and have traveled to a dozen countries (mainly Germany, Taiwan, and the Netherlands). I'm compelled by ambitious people and organizations fostering equity in society. Outside of work, you can catch me reading sci-fi, exercising, and cooking nutritious food. &nbsp; ðŸŒ±
