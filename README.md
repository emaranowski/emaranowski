I love clean, organized architecture that works seamlessly for the people who use it. I thrive on perfectionism, solving puzzles, and the satisfaction of building elegant systems. I'm experienced with full stack development in JavaScript and Python, coming from a background in SPSS for data evaluation.

As coding grew into a larger part of my career, it became a natural fit and my eventual focus. The work that led me here includes SPSS for evaluation of funding distribution and outcomes in economic equity programs; structuring databases for nonprofits; and analysis of B2B and B2C relationships.

I grew up below the poverty line, and have traveled to a dozen countries (mainly Germany, Taiwan, and the Netherlands). I'm compelled by ambitious people and organizations fostering growth in society. Outside of work, I love sci-fi literature, nutrition, and constantly learning.
