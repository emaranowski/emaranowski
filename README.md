**Hi, I'm Erica**. I love elegant software that functions seamlessly for users and organizations. On the backend I'm experienced in Flask, SQLAlchemy, Express, and Sequelize, and on the frontend in React and Redux. Previously I worked for 3+ years in data evaluation and engineering using SPSS, a language similar to SQL and R.

I thrive on designing cohesive and performant infrastructure. My background in data informs my attention to detail, organization, excellent documentation, and technical communication.

Past work includes data evaluation of statewide funding at over 50 economic opportunity nonprofits in Oregon; developing databases; B2B and B2C research; research on funding segregation in public schools; and research on social networks in wealthy educational institutions.

I grew up in Portland, Oregon, and have traveled to a dozen countries (mainly Germany, Taiwan, and the Netherlands). Outside of work, you can catch me reading sci-fi, exercising, and volunteering.
