**ðŸŒ± Hey, I'm Erica**. I love clean code that works seamlessly for those who use it. I thrive on perfectionism, solving puzzles, and the satisfaction of building elegant systems. I'm comfortable working on the frontend and backend in JavaScript and Python, coming from a background in SPSS for data evaluation.

As coding grew into a larger part of my work, it became my central focus. The work that led me here includes SPSS for evaluation of funding distribution and outcomes in economic equity programs; structuring databases for nonprofits; and analysis of B2B and B2C relationships.

I grew up below the poverty line, and have traveled to a dozen countries (mainly Germany, Taiwan, and the Netherlands). I'm compelled by ambitious people and organizations fostering growth in society. Outside of work, I love sci-fi literature, plants, nutrition, and constantly learning.
